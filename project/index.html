      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are the UPA, a group of friends that play Xbox together.  Some of us have been friends for over ten years and we are spread all over the
         United States.  We are not a competitive clan as we do not take games serious unless it is a big event that is time consuming.  We have very
         few rules and act like best friends, meaning most things we say to each other are teasing insults.  You know, the usual for gamers.</p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't take anything too personal</li>
        <li>Don't join another clan</li>
        <li>Always play on the hardest difficulty</li>
      </ul>
